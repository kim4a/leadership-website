			<h2>Personal Goal</h2>
			<p>I will graduate from Eastern Michigan University by 2021, which is in four years, have a job either in social work, or marketing because my whole end is to work for an adoption agency to help other kids get adopted and maybe even open my own one. I just want other kids to know that there is someone else who went through what they are going through at that time.</p>
			<div class="dropdowntoggle">
				<h2>Where</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdown">
				<h3>Past</h3>
				<p>I came from overseas in China, and I am an adopted child that completely changed my living. I had to learn how to take care not just myself, but the other kids in the group. I learned my values and what to stand up for. Growing up with who and what I was given made me step up and grow up.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<h3>Present</h3>
				<p>I am a freshman at Eastern Michigan University, and currently involved in my adoption groups. I go to camps every year to celebrate my heritage, teach the younger kids about our culture. Going to these camps help me meet people who work in or for the adoption agencies that sponsor these camps.</p>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<h3>Future</h3>
				<p>I plan on getting internships, which I hope leads to jobs in the social work networks. I picture myself working somewhere I love to, or hopefully one step closer to where I want to be.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdowntoggle">
				<h2>Why</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdown">
				<p>I am passionate about this because I live this adopted life, and I do not want any kid that goes through what I have to feel like they are alone. I would do it because letting others know that I am there is something I live for. Being alone is something no one should feel, and love and human relationships are my values. My critical event of being adopted will help me achieve my goal because it is a very personal subject, and I will do what I need to make sure no kid feels left behind or alone. My risk would be switching my major, and losing out the money I spent for classes that I did not need. I would try and do internships as well.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdowntoggle">
				<h2>How</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdown">
				<p>Actions I would take in this order:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Graduate from Eastern Michigan University</li>
					<li>Have either internship or job
						<ul>
							<li>If internship, then look for jobs</li>
							<li>If job, look for higher position to do what I want</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Stay in the job and move up in agency</li>
					<li>Branch off and open up my own</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdowntoggle">
				<h2>Who</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdown">
				<p>People who can help me would be anyone who sees me as potential. Anyone who believes in me, and people who would know how to get me started in that field. People who believe me will really help boost my confidence as well. I can not list people’s names for confidentiality.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdowntoggle">
				<h2>When</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="dropdown">
				<p>I can take action starting now as a freshman. I start taking classes toward that major/field work in the fall or spring of my sophomore year.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Summer 2018
						<ul>
							<li>Summer job or internship</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Fall 2018
						<ul>
							<li>School at Eastern Michigan University</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Spring 2019
						<ul>
							<li>School at Eastern Michigan University</li>
							<li>Apply to the camps for internship or job depending on what is being offered at the time</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Summer 2019
						<ul>
							<li>Summer job or internship through the camps</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I would show my appreciation either when my internship is done and it helps me get my job. If it is in my job and I move up would thank the ones who helped me move up and advance in my career.</p>
