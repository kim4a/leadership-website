			<h2>Personal Definition</h2>
			<p>Leadership is a method that can be taught to and/or learned from experience and in small increments. Leadership guides a person to help others get from where they are to where they would like to be and through all hardships as best as they can.</p>
			<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
			<p>Leadership to me is the ability to help anyone out in need. Whether it is something small like giving directions to a location or big like medical help. I believe leadership is something that people are born with as a “natural born leader,” yet to be a leader, some traits or characteristics not everyone is born with. With that being said, I believe leadership can be taught. Being assertive takes some work if a person is a bit shy, but is the leader of a group not by choice. Being a leader takes time, but can be a rewarding experience.</p>
			<h2>Three Theories/Practices</h2>
			<p>My definition reflects the Path-Goal Theory, Challenge the Process Practice, and the Trait and Behavioral Approach. I selected these practices/theories because in Path-Goal Theory there is something called “end goal” and that is where everyone would like to be as stated in my definition. Challenge the Process because in commitment 6 it explains that generating small wins and learning from experiences creates an active leader. Trait and Behavioral Approaches were brought up in my definition because leadership can be taught and/learned based on the person’s personality.</p>
