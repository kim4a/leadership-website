			<p>I took a Strengths finder test, and my results were Developer, Woo, Arranger, Positivity, and Includer. Developer is someone is seeing potential in others, and try to help the succeed in life. I like to see all my friends succeed and not fail, especially in school; therefore, I help them study because I know they can pass the test or quiz even if they do not think so. Woo stands for “Winning Others Over,” and is explained as the ability to take on the challenge of meeting new people easily. I love meeting new people and have no problem walking up to someone to introduce myself. Arranger is like being the conductor, and can come up solutions to complex problems, yet watch over as the solutions are put into place. I love helping people out, and when given a problem I start almost immediately thinking of how to help. Positivity, is described as always having a smile on one’s face, giving praise, and looking at the positive side. Positivity is a strength of mine because I do love to smile and I have this saying, “The day I stop smiling is the day I die.” Furthermore, Includer was my last result from the Strength finder test stating- “stretching the circle” is must because there is always the liking of adding more people into the group. Including others into my circle is something I enjoy because I never liked being outside, which makes me sad when someone is left outside. For example, I think of them like a sad, lost puppy because then it breaks my heart and I want others to feel welcomed.</p>
