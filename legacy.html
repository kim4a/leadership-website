			<p>It takes a lot for a student to be a leader on campus. The student has to know him or herself inside and outside. The leader should be confident in his or herself. They need to be ready for all the obstacles they will face with his or her followers or even alone. It is okay to show that they need help, but weakness that are worked on together become strengths.  As long as the student puts forth the effort and tries, then the followers will see and believe in that student.</p>
			<p>As a leader I hope to be thought as a good leader. I hope I was seen as helpful and insightful. I hope I am viewed as the leader who never gives up and ready for all challenges. All in all, I hope people see me as a leader they would like to follow.</p>
